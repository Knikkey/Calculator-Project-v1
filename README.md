Calculator with tutorial

I followed a YouTube tutorial to try and make this. After a full day, it wouldn't work and I couldn't figure out why. I spent a good 2 hours going through the code and trying to find where I made mistakes. I couldn't find it. In the end, I just copy and pasted his code and it worked. I hate coding.
